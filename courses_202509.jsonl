The class will design original graphic works in various software platforms (Google Earth, Comic Life, InDesign, Pixton, Comic Maker) using both literary and design frameworks. Units include: memoir, graphic medicine, digital/online comics, and interactive narrative games. Through close textual analysis, peer critique, and iterative thinking/practice, students learn to create digital projects that use image/text to tell stories and analyze literature. Projects may include: digital theory comix, graphic essays, graphic narrative maps in Google Earth, and video essays.
