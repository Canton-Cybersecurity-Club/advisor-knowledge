Earn 30 SUNY-General Education Requirement (SUNY-GER) credits, which requires you to complete one or more courses in the following areas:\n\nThese 4 required areas*:\n\nCommunication: Written/Oral, Natural Science and Scientific Reasoning, Diversity: Equity, Inclusion and Social Justice, Mathematics\n\nAny 3 of these 6 areas:\n\nArts, Humanities, World History and Global Awareness, Social Science, US History and Civic Engagement, World Languages\n\n*If you entered SUNY prior to Fall 2023, you may qualify to follow the General Education requirements in place at the time you were admitted. See your advisor or dean's office for details.\n\n#### 2. Demonstrate competency in:\n2 required areas: \n\nCritical Thinking, Information Literacy\n\n# Course Grades Required\nIf you earn a grade of C or higher in a SUNY-GER course, the course is guaranteed to satisfy the SUNY-GER and degree credit requirements. If you are transferring, check with your transfer campus to find out which grades are needed for that campus and your transfer program, because some bachelor\u2019s degree majors require a grade higher than a C in specific courses, and some campuses and programs may accept grades below a C.\n\n# Effective Date:\nPolicy is effective Fall 2023. If you entered SUNY between fall 2010 and fall 2023, you may be eligible to follow the General Education Requirements in place for your catalog year.\n\nNOTES:\nIf you are entering SUNY Canton in an Associate Degree program and plan to transfer to another SUNY college, complete as many SUNY-GER courses as possible before you transfer. Try to complete at least 7 SUNY-GER knowledge and skills areas (Natural Science, Social Sciences, American History, Western Civilization, Other World Civilizations, Humanities, The Arts, and Foreign Language), including the 2 required areas (Mathematics and Basic Communication). If you complete all 30 credits in 7 or more SUNY-GER knowledge and skills areas (including the 2 required areas), you will have met the SUNY-General Education Requirements at every SUNY campus. If you complete the right SUNY-GER courses for your transfer campus and program, you will be making good progress toward your bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nPlan for transfer with your academic advisor. If you are planning to transfer to a SUNY college, you must work closely with your academic advisor to select the right SUNY-GER courses to ensure you will meet the necessary general education requirements at SUNY Canton and to meet your transfer goals. You should also aim to earn a grade of C or higher in these courses. For each SUNY transfer campus and major you are considering, ask your advisor about:\n\n    - The specific SUNY-GER courses required. Every SUNY-GER course counts toward meeting the SUNY-GER at every SUNY campus. However, there may be a difference between meeting the SUNY-GER and meeting specific degree requirements.\n\nContact Information or Questions About General Education\nOffice of the Provost\nSUNY Canton\n34 Cornell Drive\nCanton, NY 13617\nPhone: 315-386-7202\nFax: 315-386-7945\nprovostoffice@canton.edu"

You can make the most of this appointment by showing up prepared. \n\nMake an appointment for a time when you can devote your attention to talking with the advisor. If you come in person, put your phone away. If you talk with an advisor by phone then turn off other notifications and schedule at a time when you can also be at a computer. This is an important step in your college success, so you really want to be ready to listen and participate.\n   \nYou should have some materials ready:\n\n        Your Degree Checklist\n        The General Education Requirements\n\nLet the advisor know of any other commitments that you need to work around (athletic practice, work schedule, day care hours, part-time attendance, etc.)\n\nReview the course offerings for Fall semester on UCanWeb (you can also log in to UCanWeb then go to ->Student Registration & Records -> Registration -> Look Up Classes)\n\nMake a list of any questions that you have.\n\nBe open to suggestions for courses, but bring your own ideas.\n\nDon't forget that it is your responsibility to go ahead and schedule your classes on UCanWeb!

Use UCanWeb to view your transcript and your Degree Evaluation. Then come up with a list of courses you think you should take next.\n\nIdentify the courses you are currently taking and be honest about any that will need to be retaken (log in to UCanWeb, click Student Menu > UCanWeb9 \nRegistration Menu > View Registration Information, then select the current semester in the dropdown).\n\nIdentify some potential courses for next semester and look at the class schedule to see if/when they are offered.\n\nMake a list of questions related to scheduling, including course content, pre-requisites and possible career areas.\n\nRemind your advisor, if necessary, of your own scheduling needs - attending part-time, online or only on certain days.\n\nBe open to suggestions for courses, and bring your own ideas.
